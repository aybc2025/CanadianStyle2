        "text": "The use of abbreviations has gained greater acceptance as an increasing number of new products and organizations are identified by shorter and more easily recognizable word forms. In addition to abbreviations in the strict sense (including the short forms of common nouns, Latin expressions and titles), this chapter contains information and recommendations regarding acronyms, initialisms, and symbols such as those for metric units, which are uniform in many languages."

          "In general, abbreviate words only when the short form will be immediately recognized by the reader, and ensure that the same abbreviation is used elsewhere in your text to represent the word or words involved.",
          "Some standard abbreviations such as i.e., AD, IQ, ESR, CBC and MP do not have to be spelled out because they are well known and in many cases occur as dictionary entries.",
          "Many commonly used words that are actually abbreviations are now rarely regarded as such, including ad, fridge, phone, exam, memo, photo and math. Most such words should be avoided in formal writing, although cello and bus are exceptions to this rule."
